# nosql-challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. 

In this challenge, I was contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. 

There are 3 parts to this challenge:

Part 1: Database and Jupyter Setup

Part 2: Update Database 

Part 3: Exploratory Analysis 

To help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid, 'Eat Safe, Love' has 4 questions: 

1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?

3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.

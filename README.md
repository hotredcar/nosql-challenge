# nosql-challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. 

In this challenge, I was contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. 

There are 3 parts to this challenge:

Part 1: Database and Jupyter Setup

Part 2: Update Database 

Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
